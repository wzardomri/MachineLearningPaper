Machine Learning Verification and Correction
By Omri Steinberg-Tatman and Jackson Vaughn

On this github page is the paper we wrote together about the use of machine learning for the application of hardware correction and verification.
The paper is open to read and share, along with all of the code written from generation to analysis.

We hope to have our paper published soon, and are planning a couple followup papers in the future! 
Please reach out with any questions and comments.

The Verilog code to generate the digital output can be found HERE

The Python code used to train and analyze the models can be found HERE
